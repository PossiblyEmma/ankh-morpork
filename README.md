# Ankh-Morpork

**_Discworld: Ankh-Morpork_** is a board game by Martin Wallace and Treefrog Games set
in Terry Pratchett's Discworld. It is by far my favourite board game, but
unfortunately it was only printed between 2011â€“2015, so it's hard to come by. As
my copy is starting to show the wear and tear of years of use, I wanted to take
some steps to preserve the game in a digital format, so that hopefully it won't
be lost.

This is going to be a long project, most likely, so the current priority is
simply to capture the game rules and contents. Other considerations like making
it look good or be playable in anything other than a test state will come later.
